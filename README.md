###Project Title1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Bike Purchase Behavior
1. Executive Summary
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand the factors that influence a customer's decision to purchase a bike. By using Python, specifically the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries, I analyzed the data's structure, identified key demographic trends and patterns, and uncovered potential data issues. The analysis provides actionable insights into customer behavior, which can be used to inform marketing strategies and business decisions.

2. Dataset Overview
Source: Excel Project Dataset (Raw data)

Description: The dataset contains 366 rows and 14 columns of customer information, including demographics (Gender, Age, Married Status), financial data (Income), lifestyle choices (Home Owner, Cars), and regional information (Region). The primary objective of the analysis was to understand the target variable, Purchased Bike.

3. Key Findings & Insights
Customer Profile: The analysis revealed that the typical bike purchaser is most likely a middle-aged single female.

Income & Purchase: While the average income of bike purchasers is slightly higher than non-purchasers, the median income is the same for both groups. This suggests that a higher income is not a strict requirement for a purchase, but bikes are more popular among high-income earners.

Home & Car Ownership: A strong correlation was found between bike purchase and home and car ownership. A majority of bike purchasers are homeowners, and the largest group of purchasers owns zero cars, suggesting that bikes may serve as a primary mode of transport for this demographic.

Regional Trends: The Europe region showed the highest number of bike purchasers, indicating a significant market opportunity in that area.

4. Technical Skills Demonstrated
Data Loading & Inspection: Used Pandas to load the CSV file and inspect its structure, data types, and identify missing values.

Data Cleaning: Confirmed the dataset was clean, with no duplicate rows or inconsistent data formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Formulated and answered meaningful business questions by calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations.

Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a variety of plots (bar charts, box plots, scatter plots) to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.

Hypothesis Testing: Framed initial findings as hypotheses and used analytical methods to either support or challenge them, demonstrating a solid understanding of data-driven conclusions.

5. Conclusion
This project successfully applied a comprehensive EDA framework to a real-world dataset. The insights gained provide a clear understanding of the customer demographics and key factors influencing bike purchases.
